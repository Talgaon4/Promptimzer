# Promptimizer Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 18, 2025**

## Introduction

Promptimizer ("we", "our", or "extension") is a Chrome extension designed to optimize prompts for AI chat platforms. This Privacy Policy explains how the extension collects, uses, and protects user information.

## Information We Collect

Promptimizer collects and processes the following types of information:

1. **User-provided OpenAI API Key**: Stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API.
2. **User Settings**: Configuration preferences such as maximum token settings.
3. **Prompt Content**: Text that users enter into AI chat platforms and choose to optimize.

## How We Use Information

Information collected by Promptimizer is used solely for the following purposes:

1. **To Provide Core Functionality**: Your OpenAI API key is used to make API calls to OpenAI for prompt classification and optimization.
2. **To Apply User Preferences**: Your settings are used to customize the optimization experience.

## Data Storage and Security

- All data (API keys, settings) is stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's secure storage API.
- Your OpenAI API key never leaves your browser except when making direct API calls to OpenAI's servers.
- No data is stored on our servers or in any external databases.
- No user data is transmitted to any third parties other than OpenAI (when you click the "Optimize" button).

## Third-Party Services

Promptimizer interacts with the following third-party services:

- **OpenAI API**: When you use the "Optimize Prompt" feature, your prompt is sent to OpenAI's API for analysis and optimization using your own API key. This transmission is subject to [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

## Data Retention

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Data persists only as long as the extension remains installed
- You can clear all stored data at any time by removing the extension
- No data backups are maintained

## Your Rights and Choices

You have complete control over your data:
- You can view and modify your stored API key through the extension's options page
- You can adjust optimization settings at any time
- You can uninstall the extension to remove all stored data

## Children's Privacy

Promptimizer is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
