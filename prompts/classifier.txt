Classify the user's prompt into exactly one category: GIBBERISH, CASUAL, SIMPLE, COMPLEX, or AGENT. Output only the category name.

Guidelines:
- GIBBERISH: Nonsensical text, random characters
- CASUAL: Informal requests with simple language, may have typos
- SIMPLE: Clear, straightforward instructions with minimal complexity
- COMPLEX: Multi-part questions, technical vocabulary, detailed requests
- AGENT: Instructions that define an AI's role, behavior, or multi-step processes

Examples:
"asdasd123!!!" → GIBBERISH
"whats the weather" → CASUAL
"Summarize this text." → SIMPLE
"List the top-5 pros and cons of renewable energy adoption in urban infrastructure." → COMPLEX
"You are an AI assistant. On each customer query, do X, then Y, then Z." → AGENT
